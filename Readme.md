# Incrowd - Sports News

**We want to provide stability in new News by implementing cron-job calling external data feed and transforming data into consistent and desirable format that the app developers can consume, so that, as is often the case, when the external provider has issues we can still provide data to the apps, albeit stale data.**

To address this, I implemented a cronjob that runs every 5-minute, which periodically updates the data in our mongoDB. This approach balances the need for resource availability with the need to avoid overloading the provider feed API with too many requests. Instead, we want to strike a balance between freshness and efficiency, which is why we decided to use a 5-minute cron timer. As a general rule, it is recommended to limit the number of requests per minute to an external API to a reasonable number to avoid overloading the server or causing a denial of service (DoS) attack. Typically, most APIs have rate limiting policies in place to prevent excessive usage, and it is important to respect those limits to avoid getting banned or blocked. Since, I dont know the policies of data feed provider, I can't be more accurate in my decision.

The importance of this approach is illustrated by the hypothetical case of Leo Messi returning to FC Barcelona. If our cron job is set to run every 30 min or 2 hours, there is a possibility that the news about Messi's return might not appear in our database, which would impact badly in our traffic and customer experience, and we dont want that in incrowd. To avoid this, we need to periodically update our database with fresh data from the provider feed API.

Overall, I believe that the approach I took to the technical test strikes a balance between efficiency, freshness, and customer satisfaction, and will be effective in meeting the needs of business.
